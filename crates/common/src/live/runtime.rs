//! The centralized Tokio runtime for a running Nautilus system.
//!
//! # Design Rationale
//!
//! NautilusTrader uses a single global Tokio runtime because:
//! - A single long-lived runtime avoids repeated startup/shutdown overhead.
//! - The runtime is lazily initialized on first call to `get_runtime()` via `OnceLock`.
//! - Worker thread count is configurable via the `NAUTILUS_WORKER_THREADS` environment variable.
//!
//! # Python Support
//!
//! When the `python` feature is enabled, the runtime initializes the Python interpreter
//! before starting worker threads. The PyO3 module registers an `atexit` handler via
//! `shutdown_runtime()` to cleanly shut down when Python exits.
//!
//! # Testing Considerations
//!
//! The global runtime pattern makes it harder to inject test doubles. For testing:
//! - Unit tests can use `#[tokio::test]` which creates its own runtime.
//! - Integration tests should be aware they share the global runtime state.

/// Creates and configures a new multi-threaded Tokio runtime.
///
/// The number of OS threads is configured using the `NAUTILUS_WORKER_THREADS`
/// environment variable. If not set, all available logical CPUs will be used.

/// Panics if the runtime could not be created, which typically indicates
/// an inability to spawn threads or allocate necessary resources.
